        <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
            <p>
                Our client is a new restaurant in Trondheim in need of a website to reach out to customers. 
                Their aim is to provide high quality food in a relaxing and inviting atmosphere, and establish themselves as the best pizzeria in Trondheim. 
                Our client hopes to gain traffic to their website by offering unique promotions and deals in the “start-up” phase. 
                These have to be easy accessible from the home page. By offering table reservations on their website, our client wants to make it easy for their customers to plan their pizza nights in advance. </p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>The website’s main audience will be the residents of Trondheim and the tourists who find themselves looking for a place to eat. 
                The restaurant wants to attract people who appreciate high-quality cuisine, and it is therefore essential to provide a detailed and easily accessible menu. </p>
